        <p>
            Three brother bears, Grizzly, Panda and Ice Bear, 
            attempt to find their place in civilized society, 
            whether they're looking for food, 
            trying to make human friends, 
            or scheming to become famous on the internet. 
            They explore the hipster environs of the San Francisco Bay Area, 
            and it's clear the siblings have a lot to learn about a technologically driven world.

          We Bare Bears stars three bear brothers, Grizzly, Panda, and Ice Bear, as they try to assimilate into human society.

          So far the commercials and trailers look great. The show itself is a treasure. It obviously has a bright future and is bound to become one of Cartoon Network's greatest hits.
          
          The comedy is appropriate and comes at the right times, great character development, good amount of drama for a children's show, and all around fun. It's one of best cartoons yet and is destined to fall into categories with hits such as, Regular Show, Adventure Time, Gumball, and more. This show is amazing, and you must watch it before you judge it. It would be horrible if someone mistakes this beauty as something less.</p>
