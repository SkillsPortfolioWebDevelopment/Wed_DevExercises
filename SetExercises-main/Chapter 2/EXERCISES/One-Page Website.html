        <h2> Overview</h2> 
        <p>
          Three bear brothers, Grizzly, Panda, and Ice Bear, star in the animated television series "We Bare Bears," which follows their adventures. In an effort to blend in with human culture, these bears frequently visit San Francisco in order to locate food and learn more about their surroundings. Throughout the voyage, they encounter a variety of human and animal characters; some of these people assist them, while others provide difficulties.
        </br> </br> 
          The humorous series focuses on the bears' struggles to understand and use modernÂ technologies, such as making viral videos or using social media. The bears' acceptance and embrace of individuals who are different from themselves also touches on the themes of diversity and inclusivity in the book.

          We Bare Bears stars three bear brothers, Grizzly, Panda, and Ice Bear, as they try to assimilate into human society.

          So far the commercials and trailers look great. The show itself is a treasure. It obviously has a bright future and is bound to become one of Cartoon Network's greatest hits.
          
          The comedy is appropriate and comes at the right times, great character development, good amount of drama for a children's show, and all around fun. It's one of best cartoons yet and is destined to fall into categories with hits such as, Regular Show, Adventure Time, Gumball, and more. This show is amazing, and you must watch it before you judge it. It would be horrible if someone mistakes this beauty as something less.</p>
